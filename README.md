## What is TCG?

TCG is a voice-first AI application that replaces the "where should we go?" group chat, the "who's keeping score?" argument, and the "find me a barber" Google spiral with a single conversational agent.

You talk to TCG like a charismatic friend who knows every spot in your city, and it **physically controls the UI** while you speak — switching modes, opening party tools, displaying live search results, and capturing shareable memories.

What makes it different from every other voice assistant: **it's multiplayer.** Your entire friend group can scan a QR code, join the same session, send dares, queue songs, and speak directly to the AI through CruiseHQ.

> [!TIP]
> Built for the [ElevenHacks Hackathon](https://elevenlabs.io) using **ElevenLabs Conversational AI**, **Firecrawl Search API**, **Supabase Realtime**, and **Gemini Vision**.

## Features

### 🎙️ Voice-Controlled UI with 10 Client Tools

The ElevenLabs agent doesn't just reply — it **drives the interface**. Through registered Client Tools, the agent autonomously:

| Client Tool | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `switchMode` | Snaps the UI between Locator, Plug, Game Master, and Tools |
| `openTool` | Opens a specific party tool (coin, dice, bottle, randomizer, timer) |
| `createMemory` | Captures a screenshot via `html2canvas`, uploads to Supabase Storage, saves a Trophy with a viral `shareCaption` |
| `updateGameState` | Updates the Game Session dashboard (players, scores, turns, rules) |
| `displayResults` | Populates search result cards from Firecrawl data |
| `showQR` | Displays the CruiseHQ QR code (dynamically generated via `api.qrserver.com`) |
| `randomizeGroups` | Shuffles active guests into groups (supports auto, self-select, and smart mode sorting) |
| `setGroupLeader` | Elects and announces a specific guest as the captain of their group |
| `analyzeImage` | Opens camera for OCR/Vision (bill splitting, barcode verification, drink checks, game vision) |
| `captureScreen` | Instant screenshot memory with auto-generated caption |
| `stopListening` | Mutes the mic at the hardware level; tap the TCG character or say "unmute" to resume |
| `getAutoLocation` | Triggers device geolocation, prompting the user for permission if not yet granted |

### 🧠 Engineered System Prompt

The agent prompt is constructed with structured XML tags:

- `<dynamic_context>` — User name, location, current mode, room code, active guests, and wingman preferences injected at session start
- `<role>` — TCG persona definition ("world-class AI concierge, local expert, and game master")
- `<personality_core>` — Energy matching, personalization, humor style, brevity rules, cultural awareness
- `<core_workflows>` — 6 numbered workflows mapping intents to tool chains
- `<critical_behaviors>` — Latency management (filler words before tool execution), barge-in recovery, proactive memory captures (max 2-3/session)
- `<advanced_nlp_handling>` — Multi-threaded request triage, slang comprehension, auto-pivot on interruptions

### 🔍 Firecrawl-Powered Live Search

Every search goes through a production-grade 3-tier pipeline:

1. **Supabase Persistent DB** — 7-day TTL cache of previous results
2. **Upstash Redis** — 15-minute fast cache for repeat queries
3. **Firecrawl Search API** — live web scrape with dynamic query formulation

Queries are context-aware. Asking for a "wild game for 6 people" generates `"for 6 players wild hilarious high-energy party game rules"`. Game searches extract full Markdown rules so the agent can teach players how to play.

### 👥 CruiseHQ — Multiplayer Rooms

The host generates a 4-character room code. Guests scan a QR code and land in a **full two-way CruiseHQ interface** — the same one the host uses, with guest-appropriate controls.

**Group System:** The host (or agent via `randomizeGroups` tool) can split guests into named groups. CruiseHQ provides tabbed chat with a **Main Room** and a tab per group — messages are scoped by group. The host manages group membership; guests can nominate, vote, or randomize a **Group Leader** (their elected group representative) directly from within their group tab.

**Guest Privileges:**
- Full two-way chat in Main Room and their assigned Group tab
- 🎲 Random Leader, 📊 Group Leader Poll, 🎯 Randomizer, 📥 Drop submissions
- 🖼️ Push images to the host's full-screen overlay
- 🎙️ Request Co-host (approved manually or by voice) — grants remote mic via SpeechRecognition, injected into the live agent session

**Host-only Controls:**
- ⚙️ Groups Setup tab (create, clear, configure groups and assign members)
- 📊 Broadcast Poll — host-initiated polls sent to the whole room

**In-Room Tools for Everyone:**

- 🎯 **Randomizer** — Slot-machine-style picker that auto-loads active group members
- 📥 **Drop Submissions** — Truth, Dare, Charades, Suggestions; options for anonymous drops

**Guest Actions from `/room/{CODE}`:**

| Action | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 💬 Chat | Real-time two-way message in Main or Group tab |
| 🔥 Dare | Injected into the voice agent's live context |
| 🤫 Truth | Injected into the voice agent's live context |
| 🎵 Song | Song request queued to the host |
| 🎭 Charades | Hidden word sent to host — shows `[HIDDEN]` in transcript |
| Tag **@TCG** | The AI responds directly to that guest |
| 🎙️ Request Co-host | Host approves (manual or voice) → guest gets remote mic |
| 📸 Save to Memories | Any chat message can be captured as a Trophy |

The agent is aware of all guests in real-time. When someone joins or leaves, it acknowledges them by name.

### 📸 Vision System

Point your camera at anything and TCG analyzes it:

- **Bill Scanner** — Reads receipt totals and extracts currency, splitting the bill globally
- **Actionable Drink Checks** — OCR extracts barcodes (queried via Open Food Facts API) to confirm product authenticity
- **Game Vision** — Identifies board/card game state and suggests next moves
- **User-Directed Analysis** — Users can type custom instructions while snapping a photo to override the default task logic

Powered by Gemini Vision API with structured JSON output fed back into the voice conversation.

### 🎲 9 Party Tools

All voice-activatable and multiplayer-aware:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| 🪙 Coin Flip | Animated coin with heads/tails |
| 🎲 Dice Roll | 1–6 dice, 2–100 sides |
| 🍾 Spin the Bottle | SVG wheel synced with room guests |
| 🎯 Randomizer | Slot-machine picker, loadable from guest list |
| ⏱ Timer / Stopwatch | Circular progress, configurable countdown |
| 💰 Bill Splitter | Global location-aware currency calculation |
| 🃏 Truth or Dare | 3 intensity levels (Mild / Spicy / Savage) |
| 🎭 Charades | 4 categories including Hardcore |
| 🏆 Scoreboard | Auto-synced with CruiseHQ guests |

### 🏆 Trophy Room & Memory System

Memorable moments are captured as screenshots via `html2canvas`, uploaded to Supabase Storage, and displayed in a shareable gallery at `/trophy-room`. The agent proactively suggests captures (max 2-3 per session) and generates viral `shareCaption` text.

**Memory Types:** `location_drop` · `game_win` · `plug_moment` · `cruisehq_quote` · `party_milestone` · `group_capture` · `moment`

**Manual Capture:** A floating 📸 button (FAB) lets the user manually save a memory at any time, independent of voice.

### 🌊 Waveform Visualizer

A full-width animated waveform sits behind the character avatar. It reacts to agent state (speaking vs. listening) and changes color per mode: green for Locator, gold for Plug, red for Game Master.

### ⚙️ Settings & Wingman Protocols

- **Settings Modal** — Quick name change without leaving the conversation
- **Profile Page (`/profile`)** — Persistent display name and **Wingman Protocols** (e.g., "Always suggest dive bars", "Keep it PG", "Roast me constantly"). These are injected into the system prompt at session start
- **Dynamic Agent Selection** — The ElevenLabs Agent ID is configurable, allowing different voice personas

### 💬 Chat Fallback

A slide-up transcript drawer provides full text chat. Users can type messages (routed into the live ElevenLabs session via `sendUserMessage()`), view the conversation history, browse search result cards, and push images to full-screen.

## How It Uses ElevenLabs

TCG pushes ElevenLabs beyond basic TTS/STT:

- **Client Tools** — The voice agent autonomously calls `switchMode()`, `openTool()`, `showQR()`, and `analyzeImage()` to control the React frontend in real-time
- **Dynamic System Prompt** — User name, location, active guests, room code, and wingman preferences are injected into the prompt at session start
- **Multiplayer Injection** — Guest messages, dares, and @mentions are routed into the live session via `conversation.sendUserMessage()`

## How It Uses Firecrawl

The Firecrawl integration goes far beyond a basic search wrapper:

- **Dynamic Query Engine** — Translates conversational intent into structured search queries with contextual modifiers (energy level, urgency, player count)
- **Selective Deep Scrape** — Game searches request `markdown` format to extract full rule sets for voice readback
- **3-Tier Cache** — Supabase (7-day) → Redis (15-min) → Firecrawl API. Aggressively mitigates rate limits and costs
- **Background Persistence** — Fresh results are asynchronously saved to Supabase tables (`tcg_locations`, `tcg_games`, `tcg_plugs`) for future instant retrieval
